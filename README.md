Project Title: Dungeon Master Utility (Working Title)

Project Description:

Dungeon Master Utility is planned as an essential android assistance application to any prospective Dungeon Masters and Players alike, providing all the important tools in the palm of your hands for managing tabletop gaming. 

The Character Manager section will allow for players to manage all of their creations. The Character Creator activity will allow you to fill up a character sheet from scratch, picking your species and class, choosing feats and abilities, and rolling for stats. You can then view and manage your characters in the Character List activity. View your characters, edit any changes or errors that have been made, and level up your characters that youâ€™ve made.
Check the Codex section for any information that you may need in future adventures. New players can view the Playable Races & Classes activities to help come up with ideas for future characters, showing each race's special abilities and class specialization. The Bestiary activity can be viewed to see the legions of enemies, with their descriptions and stats, and their monstrous sounds. This is useful for players to prepare for future fights, and Dungeon Masters to craft future battles. 

The Game Tools section can be used to simulate and supplement many different parts of a tabletop session. For basic functions, you can use the Roll Simulator activity, where you can choose the number and size of dice to roll, simulating anything from perception checks to abilities. The Damage Calculator activity can be used to calculate damage, factoring in armor and attack bonuses, along with similar dice rolling functions. The Random Session Generator activity can be used to easily create a session with the press of a button, randomly stringing together a selected number of scenarios from a list.
